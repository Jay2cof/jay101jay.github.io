      <p><em>Dog are man's best friend, when you have one, its like having a partner, but they also have their challeages, as you will have a great daily responsibilies, of his welfare and good health.</em></p>
      <p>About a 100.000 dogs are officially registered as living in Berlin, the real number is probably twice as high. And it makes sense, Berlin is, all in all, a quite dog-friendly city, especially compared to other cities of its size and influence. Paris is the worst city for dogs I ever experienced, and I wouldn’t even think about taking my dog to London or New York, but having a dog in Berlin is something very enjoyable.</p>

      <h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
      <p>The Australian Shepherd is traditionally a medium-sized breed of solid build. They can weigh from 30 to 65 pounds (14 to 29 kg) and stand from 17 to 26 inches (43 to 66 cm) in height. The Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA) standard calls for the Australian shepherd to stand between 18 and 23 inches (46 and 58 cm) at the withers, females being 18 to 21 inches (46 to 53 cm) and males measuring 20 to 23 inches (51 to 58 cm); however, quality is not to be sacrificed in favor of size.Recently, Australian Shepherds have been selectively bred in favor of size to develop Miniature and Toy Aussies. The American Stock Dog Registry (ASDR) now recognizes three sizes. The above description is considered a Standard Aussie (height 18 to 23 inches for males and females). Miniature Australian Shepherds (or Mini Aussies) stand 14 to 18 inches tall, while Toy Aussies stand between 10 and 14 inches</colour;red></p>
      <h2><strong>Parks</strong></h2>
      <p>Berlin is a dog-friendly city, and this is proven once more by the many possibilities to let your pup run free, play with its pals and get dirty. After the first part of my Dogs in Berlin guide was all about the rules of dog owning, this one’s all about the fun and play: a selection of the nicest dog parks in Berlin and my favorite forests and lakes. Get your play on!</p>
